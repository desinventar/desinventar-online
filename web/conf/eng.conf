msgGeolevels_HelpText=Para o manejo da geografia em DesInventar é preciso considerar os conceitos de resolução e hierarquia. A resolução é o nível de detalhe espacial ao qual serão referidos os dados; todos os registros/formulários devem estar então relacionados à mesma unidade espacial, por exemplo, município. A hierarquia dos níveis geográficos refere-se à subordinação, concatenada hierarquicamente, das unidades territoriais, isto é: os níveis geográficos superiores ou de menor resolução (por exemplo, país ou estado) incluem níveis inferiores ou de maior resolução (por exemplo, país contem regiões, regiões contem estados, estados contem municípios, etc.) subordinados uns aos outros até atingir o nível da resolução da base de dados.
mgeography=Geographic units
msgGeography_Tooltip=Unidades geográficas. Para cada um dos níveis geográficos considerados, devem ser incorporadas todas as unidades geográficas ou administrativas que o compõem.

[events]
ACCIDENT=Vehicular, rail, air or maritime transport accidents. This term is limited to those accidents resulting from natural phenomenon such as landslides, earthquakes, hurricanes, rainfall or adverse atmospheric conditions, etc. It includes those transport accidents which generate leaks of toxic substances, whatever the cause. Key words: vehicular accident, train accident, air accident, shipping accidents.
AVALANCHE=Fall or loosening of masses of ice and/or snow. Key words: avalanche.
ALLUVION=Torrents of water which drag great quantities of solid material (pebbles, gravel and rocks). This term is applicable when referring to the effects of sudden rainfall on hitherto dry regions or dry riverbeds. Key words: torrent, mudslide, landslide.
SPATE=Violent flow of water in a gorge, sometimes reported as a sudden rise or as a torrent. This term is applied, for example, when a –landslide- is reported, when the torrent carries tree trunks and/or abundant sediment, ranging from fine-grained to masses of rock. It may be caused by rainfall, rupture of a dam, or by abundant landslides in a gorge. It excludes avalanches, as these imply snow or ice fall. Key words: flash flood, rapids, 
BIOLOGICAL=Death or migration of biological species. This may be ultimately attributable to contamination or to drastic changes in environmental parameters. One example is the –red tide- the warming of waters due to the phenomenon of El Niño or the lessening of optimum amounts of oxygen due to obstacles imposed by humans, such as dams and barrages.
POLLUTION=Concentration of contaminating substances in the air, water or soil, at levels which are damaging to human, animal, or plant life.
LANDSLIDE=Mass movement of the earth surface. Key words: landslide, subsidence or settling, drift, cave-in, crevice formation, collapse of caves or mines, rockfall, crumbling of earth or rocks (slowly or quickly) down slopes or hillsides, blockage of roads, channels, excavations.
EPIDEMIC=Disease which attacks one or more individuals in the same area (over days, weeks, months) exceeding the expected frequency: such as cholera, typhoid fever, bubonic plague, etc. It should be taken into account that the declaration of an epidemic depends on the endemic conditions of the disease and the region. Key words: illness, endemic, pandemic.

This term includes structural damage that, while not necessarily leading to collapse, renders the structure unusable. This type of damage may be reported as a –fault- (as in structural fault). The damage to structures caused by natural phenomenon (eg, earthquakes, landslides, flooding, etc) is reported as an effect of those phenomena. Key words: structural fault.
EXPLOSION=Abrupt liberation of a large amount of energy (thermic, chemical or nuclear), accompanied by thunderous noise and violent rupture of the containing recipient, producing heat, light and gases.

In spite of being a secondary phenomenon or caused by an –earthquake-, it has been included here as a cause of loss or damage in many inhabited areas, coastal as well as continental. Key words: liquefaction
COASTLINE=Variation in the coastline and/or maritime areas near the coast. Includes the formation and destruction of islands, beaches and sand-dunes, erosion of cliffs, with effects on population, on navigation, etc.
RAIN=Pluvial precipitation. Includes isolated, persistent or torrential rainfall in a specific region, as well as longer periods of rainfall. Key words: storm, deluge, cloudburst, downpour, showers (persistent drizzle when resulting in disasters, for example, in arid or semi-arid regions), squall.
