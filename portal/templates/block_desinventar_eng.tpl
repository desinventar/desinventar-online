<h2>What is DesInventar?</h2>

<p align="justify"> Until the mid-1990’s, systematic information about the
occurrence of daily disasters of small and medium impact was not available
in Latin America, nor in the Andean Sub-region.  From 1994, the creation of
a common conceptual and methodological framework was begun by groups of
researchers, academicians, and institutional actors linked to the Network of
Social Studies in the Prevention of Disasters in Latin America (Red de
Estudios Sociales en Prevención de Desastres en América Latina - LA RED).
These groups conceptualised a system of acquisition, consultation and
display of information about disasters of small, medium and greater impact,
based on pre-existing data, newspaper sources and institutional reports in
nine countries in Latin America.  The developed conceptualisation,
methodology and software tool is called Disaster Inventory System -
DesInventar (Sistema de Inventario de Desastres DesInventar).</p>


<p align="justify">The development of DesInventar, with its conception that
makes visible disasters from a local scale (town or equivalent), facilitates
dialogue for risk management between actors, institutions, sectors,
provincial and national governments.</p>

<p align="justify">DesInventar is a conceptual and methodological tool for
the construction of databases of loss, damage, or effects caused by
emergencies or disasters.  It includes: methodology (definitions and help in
the management of data) database with flexible structure; software for input
into the database; software for consultation of data (not limited to a
predefined number of consultations) with selection options for search
criteria.</p>
